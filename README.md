The Photometric LSST AStronomical TIme-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) was a Kaggle competition run in Fall 2018 that aimed to identify promising probabilistic classifiers of astronomical lightcurves of the quality anticipated of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
This repository is home to a website for exploring the rich data sets yielded by PLAsTiCC.
